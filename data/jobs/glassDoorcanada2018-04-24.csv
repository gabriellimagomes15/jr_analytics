JD_2642069353,Data Scientist - Fraud Detection & Cyber Security, RBC, – Toronto, 10 days ago,"What is the opportunity? Study of threat landscape reveals that the number of cyber-attacks has increased significantly over the past decade. Attackers are more sophisticated and better organized than any time before, and attacks are becoming more and more complex in nature. Traditional solutions, mostly based on signatures and predetermined rules, are therefore incapable of handling complex threat scenarios. Moreover, they lack required scalability and do not provide proper context and sufficient transparency into events and activities, which are essential for carrying out effective forensic activities. To overcome these challenges, the Cyber Security program at the RBC takes an alternative approach by leveraging advanced Machine Learning techniques and Big Data technologies to model and predict the behavior of users/devices and extract actionable information from cyber security data, hence delivering Proactive Threat Detection and Response. What will you do?Work with fraud and cyber security experts and other Data Scientists to design and develop Machine Learning algorithms to identify high-risk/fraudulent transactions and complex threat scenarios.Build on the knowledge of threat models and attack trees (provided by subject matter experts) to analyze structured and unstructured data (e.g. online banking transactions, network security devices, threat intelligence) and identify malicious patterns of behavior and misuse.Baseline user/device behavior and identify anomalous activities.Enable the business to adopt and promote a proactive approach to fraud, cyber threat, and misuse identification.Participate in Proof of Concept or Proof of Technology projects to evaluate fraud detection and cyber security technologies and platforms.Operate third party technologies to analyze security data and identify threats and misuse cases, evaluating the capabilities of those technologies.Participate in the creation of detailed plans and accurate estimates toward the development, testing and implementation of proactive threat detection capabilities.Contribute to the successful completion of projects by identifying risks and developing/ recommending mitigation strategies.What do you need to succeed?Must-haveBackground in Computer Science, Computational Science, Mathematics or related fieldAdvanced programming skills in one or more of the following languages: Python, R, ScalaExperience with user behavior analysis, aimed at fraud detection and the risk scoring of transactionsExperience with Big Data processing technologies (e.g. Spark)Knowledge of Parallel Programming and High Performance ComputingKnowledge of general Machine Learning concepts (both in theory and application) and experience with advanced topics (e.g. Manifold Learning, Sequence Labeling, Probabilistic Graphical Models)Experience with data preprocessing, feature and representation learning and anomaly/outlier detectionNice-to-haveKnowledge of network and information securityKnowledge of Hadoop ecosystemAbility to develop statistical tests and run controlled trialsWhats in it for you?
